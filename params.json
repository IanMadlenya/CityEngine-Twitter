The video below is the first step in an approach to visualising an urban landscape using the objects that already exist in it; instead of abstract swirling points, bars, and artefacts hovering in the sky, _the buildings themselves_ become the medium by which the data generated in and around them are made visible.  \r\n\r\n[video]\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe taller a building is, the more geotagged tweets have been sent from within and immediately adjacent to it. Buildings grow upwards in real time, and gradually darken as more data accumulate.\r\n\r\nWe are not limited to using tweets to generate these landscapes; any source of real-time data can be used to affect the shape, height, and colour of the objects you see.  \r\n\r\nWe gathered geotagged tweets for 15 hours and 40 minutes for this first video, beginning at 21:45 on Monday the 2nd of July, 2013. We gathered a total of 3568 data points, which were visualised using Esri's CityEngine.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Project created by Stephan HÃ¼gel ([@urschrei](https://twitter.com/urschrei)) and Flora Roumpani ([@en_topia](https://twitter.com/en_topia)) at UCL [CASA](http://bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/casa)  \r\n\r\n![UCL Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis](casa_black.png)","google":"UA-41949150-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
